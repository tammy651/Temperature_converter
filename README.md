## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system was designed to solve the problem of converting temperature values between different measurement units. Users require a simple, accurate, and easy-to-use temperature conversion tool.

**Functional Requirements**
- Accept temperature input from the user
- Allow users to select a conversion option
- Display accurate conversion results

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- User-friendly interface
- Accurate calculations
- Easy to maintain and extend

---

### 2. System Design
The system follows a menu-driven design. Each temperature conversion is handled using separate functions to ensure modularity and readability.

**Design Tools**
- Pseudocode
- Flowchart (optional)

---

### 3. Implementation
The application was implemented using the Python programming language. Python was chosen due to its simplicity and readability.

---

### 4. Testing
The system was tested using:
- Valid temperature values
- Invalid inputs (letters and symbols)
- Boundary values such as zero and negative temperatures

---

### 5. Deployment
The project was deployed by uploading the source code and documentation to a GitHub repository.

---

### 6. Maintenance
Future improvements may include:
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Supporting more temperature units
- Converting the application to a web or mobile app
